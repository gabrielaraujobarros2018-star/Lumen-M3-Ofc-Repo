# Compress Lumen in FX File Explorer in Android

In FX File Explorer, after selecting your folder and tapping "Create Archive" > ZIP:

- Look for "Compression level" or slider; drag to "Maximum," "Ultra," or 9 (DEFLATE level 9).
- Enable "Solid archive" if available—it treats the whole folder as one block for 5-15% better ratios on mixed files.
- Confirm and start; expect 1-4 hours depending on content (text/code compresses best).
