# COMPRESSING LUMEN M3

## Compress Lumen in FX File Explorer in Android

In FX File Explorer, after selecting your folder and tapping "Create Archive" > ZIP:

- Look for "Compression level" or slider; drag to "Maximum," "Ultra," or 9 (DEFLATE level 9).
- Enable "Solid archive" if available—it treats the whole folder as one block for 5-15% better ratios on mixed files.
- Confirm and start; expect 1-4 hours depending on content (text/code compresses best).

## Setting Highest Level in WinRAR

- Right-click your folder and select "Add to archive" (or drag into WinRAR): Set "Compression method" to "Best" (slowest but highest ratio).
- Choose RAR format (better than ZIP; supports dictionary up to 128MB—set to max if your PC allows).
- Check "Create solid archive" for 10-30% gains on similar files (like code).
- Advanced: Under "Advanced" tab > Compression, boost PPM memory to 64MB+ and enable text/audio filters if matching your data.

## Tips for 5GB Folder

Process takes hours; allocate 10GB+ free space. Test extract after. On Android (via RAR app), steps mirror but use "Best" too—less powerful than PC, so transfer folder first if possible. Expect 20-50% better than ZIP ultra on compressible data.
