# Lumen-M3-Ofc-Repo
Official repo for lumen M3. (Source code wrapped in ZIP on MEGA).

## IMPORTANT WARNING

From M3 Snapshot 2 and up, File count and Source size increased dramatically due to Extracted source codes (Libxml, linux kernel, wayland, etc.) to **Prepare for Modifications**. Lumen release frequency will be **Significantly slowed down** (from daily snapshots to Monthly complete builds + 2 day Breaks as planned) because Lumen exploded in size from 500mb to 900MB+ and i can't upload daily 900mb builds anymore due to cloud storage limits.
